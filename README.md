# Text Detection and Recognition System for Signboards (Computer Vision)

Created an Object Detection system using YOLOv5 to locate and classify Hindi and English signboards.Built a hybrid CNN-RNN model, combining InceptionV3 and GRU, for Optical Character Recognition to read Hindi text from images.

## Overview

This project is divided into two parts:

1. **Text Detection**: Detecting regions of interest (text areas) from signboard images using YOLOv5.
2. **Text Recognition**: Recognizing Hindi characters from the signboards.

The first part focuses on training and deploying an object detection model to locate text in images, while the second part of the project specifically focuses on recognizing Hindi characters from the signboards.
